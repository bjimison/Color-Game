The Color Game is based on the RGB color choosing scheme of CSS. RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue. The strength of each color is represented by a number between 0 and 255. This color scheme uses the following syntax: rgb(255,255,255), for example. The first number signifies the strength of red used, the second signifies the strength of green used, and the third is obviously the strength of blue.

You will be shown six squares, each containing a different color. A random color scheme will be provided at the top of the page. Use this color scheme to click on the square with the matching color.
